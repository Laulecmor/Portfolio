Professional Portfolio
For this assignmemt, I added my name on the left hand sidwe of the nav bar. On the right hand side of the nav bar I included a section for my work, about me, and contact information. 

If you click on any of the sections it will scroll you down to the corresponding information. 

I tried to get creative but was having issues getting some of the items into CSS correctly, so my photo is just under my header for now. 

In the portfolio section of the website, I have the only website that I have built and if you click the photo - it will take you the website. 

To make sure the web page is going to look nice regardless of the screen size - I made sure to add the syntax to do that in line 5 of the HTML.
